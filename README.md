# Michael — Enterprise Software Engineer | Edge AI & Industrial Automation

20+ years building enterprise systems. Now exploring where software meets the physical world.

## What I Do

**Day job:** .NET/C# enterprise architecture, REST APIs, vertical slice patterns, legacy modernization

**Nights & weekends:** Edge AI, industrial IoT, robotics, and bridging IT/OT systems

## Current Learning Projects

🤖 **Edge AI & Computer Vision** — Deploying models on Jetson Orin Nano and Raspberry Pi 5  
🔧 **Industrial Protocols** — MQTT, Modbus, OPC-UA integration patterns  
🚗 **Robotics Fundamentals** — Robot car platform for computer vision and autonomous navigation  
📊 **Sensor Integration** — Building data pipelines from physical sensors to cloud analytics

## AI Development Tools

🧠 **MCP Servers** — Python-based Model Context Protocol servers for AI agent tooling  
📚 **RAG Applications** — Retrieval Augmented Generation pipelines for domain-specific knowledge  
🦙 **Local LLM Integration** — Ollama workflows for privacy-sensitive development environments

## Tech Stack

**Enterprise:** .NET 10, C#, Entity Framework, Blazor, Azure, REST APIs, CQRS  

**AI/ML:** Python, Ollama, LangChain, RAG pipelines, MCP servers, TensorFlow Lite  

**Edge/Embedded:** Python, OpenCV, computer vision, sensor integration  

**Hardware:** Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry Pi 5, various sensor arrays, Picar-X AI Video Robot Car

**Environment:** Pop!_OS, System76 Thelio Mira (RTX 3080), Linux-first approach

## Why This Path

Most industrial automation folks come from controls engineering. Most enterprise devs never touch hardware. I'm interested in the gap between them — how do you build systems that scale from sensor to cloud with proper architecture?

The factory floor is about to get a lot smarter. Companies will need people who understand both worlds.

## Writing

I write about the journey from enterprise software to industrial systems on [Substack](https://michaelalber.substack.com/) — lessons learned, architecture decisions, and project breakdowns.

## Let's Connect

Open to conversations about industrial IoT, edge AI deployment, or bridging enterprise and embedded systems.
